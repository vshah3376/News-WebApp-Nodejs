  "content": "You dont want to have too little, but you dont want to have too much.  Bergin says the two studies both describe two different aspects of carbon lossand suggest that carbon loss appears to be a central aspect in constructing the Earth as a habitable planet.Understanding the upper bounds of how much carbon the Earth might contain tells the researchers information about when the carbon might have been delivered here.Most models have the carbon and other life-essential materials such as water and nitrogen going from the nebula into primitive rocky bodies, and these are then delivered to growing planets such as Earth or Mars, said Hirschmann, professor of earth and environmental sciences.The first study, led by U-M researcher Jie (Jackie) Li and published in Science Advances (\"Earth's carbon deficit caused by early loss through irreversible sublimation\"), finds that most of the carbon on Earth was likely delivered from the interstellar medium, the material that exists in space between stars in a galaxy.Carbon was also likely sequestered into solids within one million years of the suns birthwhich means that carbon, the backbone of life on earth, survived an interstellar journey to our planet.Too little carbon, and Earth would resemble Mars: an inhospitable place unable to support water-based life, with temperatures around minus 60.But this skips a key step, in which the planetesimals lose much of their carbon before they accrete to the planets.  Hirschmanns study was recently published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (\"Early volatile depletion on planetesimals inferred from CS systematics of iron meteorite parent bodies\").From stardust to pale blue dot: Carbon's interstellar journey to Earth  (Nanowerk News) We are made of stardust, the saying goes, and a pair of studies including University of Michigan research finds that may be more true than we previously thought.Lets embrace the uncertainty to ask what are the true upper bounds for how much carbon is very deep in the Earth, and that will tell us the true landscape were within.  A planets carbon must exist in the right proportion to support life as we know it.To better understand how Earth acquired its carbon, Li estimated the maximum amount of carbon Earth could contain.",

  "content": "Wearing a face mask can protect yourself and others from Covid-19, but the type of material and how many fabric layers used can significantly affect exposure risk, found a new study from the Georgia Institute of Technology.\"The best way to protect ourselves and others is to reduce exhaled particles at the source, and the source is our face,\" Ng said, adding, \"That really gets amplified when everyone starts wearing masks.\"Georgia Tech quickly set up the study since it already had \"a great system for testing filtration efficiency using existing instruments in the lab,\" Ng recalled.\"We found commercially available materials that provide acceptable levels of submicron particle rejection while still maintaining airflow resistance similar to a surgical mask,\" said Ryan Lively, an associate professor and John H. Woody Faculty Fellow in the School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering.Multilayered samples performed much better than single-layer samples, but people should pay attention to breathability.The researchers said people should avoid using filters such as a HEPA/MERV or vacuum bags unless they are certified to be fibreglass-free since often such filters on their own may release glass fibres that can be inhaled.The analysis showed that properly fitted and multilayer masks reject 84 per cent of particles expelled by a person when one person wears it.The study's findings were used to shape homemade face mask recommendations here last April, with the comprehensive study findings published on March 22 in the journal Aerosol Science and Technology.Mask fit is also important since particles can easily escape through gaps at the nose or through the sides of the mask.",

  "content": "ADVERTISEMENT  With little other choice, most developing countries that had the AstraZeneca on hand pushed ahead with it even as major countries in Europe suspended its use over the past week after reports that unusual blood clots were found in some recipients of the shot — despite insistence from international health agencies that there was no evidence the vaccine was responsible.Authorities in India — home to the vaccine manufacturer that will likely make a large portion of the doses destined for the developing world — said Wednesday they would continue AstraZeneca inoculations with “full vigor” as infections jumped in several parts of the country.(AP Photo/Ben Curtis, File)  KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) — The suspension of the AstraZeneca vaccine in several European countries over the past week could fuel skepticism about the shot far beyond their shores, potentially threatening the rollout of a vaccine that is key to the global strategy to stamp out the coronavirus pandemic, especially in developing nations.“It’s the best shot we have here, and we should be able to take it.”  The blow to public confidence was felt in countries such as Somalia, which began vaccinations on Tuesday, but where some said they were not keen on getting the AstraZeneca shot while many in Europe weren’t using it.“Unfortunate events” in Europe will ”clearly not be helpful for our public confidence, in building public confidence and trust on the use of that particular vaccine and other vaccines for sure,” John Nkengasong, director of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told reporters Thursday, as he encouraged African countries to continue their vaccinations.Full Coverage: Coronavirus vaccine  In an analysis released Thursday, the World Bank found that 85% of low- and middle-income countries had a plan to vaccinate but less than a third had public engagement strategies to combat hesitancy and misinformation about vaccines.Even before the latest debate over AstraZeneca, vaccine skepticism had been a concern across the world, as many people are hesitant about shots developed in record time.After initially saying it would delay use of the vaccine, Thailand said Tuesday it would carry on with AstraZeneca, and the prime minister even got his shot in public.Even before those reversals, several developing nations had said they would stick by the shot.That target almost certainly will not be met without widespread use of AstraZeneca.The suspension of the AstraZeneca vaccine in several European countries could fuel skepticism about the shot far beyond their shores, potentially threatening the rollout of a vaccine that is key to the global strategy to stamp out the coronavirus pandemic, especially in developing nations.The suspension of the AstraZeneca vaccine in several European countries could fuel skepticism about the shot far beyond their shores, potentially threatening the rollout of a vaccine that is key to the global strategy to stamp out the coronavirus pandemic, especially in developing nations.Congo, for instance, halted use of AstraZeneca, putting its vaccination campaign on hold even before it began since it has no doses of anything else.But while governments in Africa and elsewhere expressed their determination to continue using the shot, not everyone is convinced.Some developing countries have received doses of Chinese-made or Russian-made vaccines — often as donations — but, at least in Africa, these allotments have usually been relatively small.",

  "content": "Households also expect more pressure on price of services over the one-year horizon when compared to a one-quarter (three-month) period.Pandemic-induced lifestyle changes are also adding to costs for some households.Retail inflation has soared to a three-month high of 5% in February, while WPI (wholesale) inflation surged to a 27-month high of 4.2% in the same month, largely led by strengthening fuel, food and manufactured product prices.“This is really a big problem for all of us, as high prices are upsetting our monthly budget,” said Paramita Biswas, a professional singer and YouTuber in Kolkata.Coronavirus: Live updates  (Contributions by Mayur Shetty, Mamtha Asokan, Avik Das, Dipak Dash, Udit Prasanna Mukherjee and Surojit Gupta)  NEW DELHI: Households across the country are facing the onslaught of rising prices and are witnessing a sharp dent in their monthly spend capabilities as prices of vegetables, groceries and transport mount steadily.Price pressures have added to the burden of households dealing with job cuts, salary reductions and loss of income as the effect of the pandemic-induced lockdown still plays out across some sectors, despite a strong economic recovery.Recent data point to a hardening of both retail and wholesale price inflation rates.The NDA government had been successful in managing inflationary pressures since assuming power in 2014 against the backdrop of stubbornly high prices, but the pandemic-triggered price increases have upset the cart.Chinmoy Barik, who works as an engineer in an IT company, has been staying in Bengaluru for the last seven years with his wife, daughter and mother.The latest Reserve Bank of India (RBI) inflation expectation survey showed that more households expect general prices as well as inflation to increase in the next one year.A lot of extra expense has been incurred due to ordering food online during the lockdown,” he said.The surge in prices of commodities and other costs are prompting people to reduce expenses on activities such as eating out.Rajiv Bansal, a bank employee in Mumbai, has a family of three.He says the spike in fuel prices has hit his monthly budget majorly this year compared to last year.He has managed to re-negotiate the rent of his one-bedroom flat as several tenants in the complex had vacated and landlords were offering lower rates.While prices of vegetables are expected to stabilise as supplies improve, overall inflationary pressure is expected to linger for now.",

  "content": "Also read: It’s the worst time for travel, but Easy Trip is still upbeat  Tracking virus’s travels and changes  Genome sequencing involves deciphering the order of the nucleotide molecules that spell out a particular virus’s genetic code.Vaccine developers and other scientists then used this genetic information to test whether the new variants change how well the vaccines work.Ultimately, to be useful, a successful genomic surveillance program must be fast and the data needs to be made publicly available immediately to inform real-time decision-making by public health officials and vaccine manufacturers.For example, if two people have viral sequences with zero or very few differences between them, it suggests the virus was transmitted from one to the other, or from a common source.Our hospital, for example, uses genomic surveillance to detect outbreaks that otherwise are missed by traditional methods.Doctors say it’s due to use of masks, hand-washing  Setting up a genomic surveillance system  Detecting variants of concern and developing a public health response to them requires a robust genomic surveillance program.Preliminary research suggests these mutations translated into a higher rate of transmission, meaning that they spread much more easily from person to person than prior strains.Scientists can use the genetic sequences to track how the virus is being transmitted in the community and in health care facilities.Such a program is one of the public health tools that will help bring the current pandemic under control and set up the U.S. to be able to respond to future pandemics.Particularly now, as new coronavirus variants of concern continue to emerge, genomic surveillance has an important role to play in helping bring the pandemic under control.Not very well, and well behind other developed countries, coming in 34th in the number of SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced per number of cases.Surveillance can provide a warning  But how do researchers know if variants are emerging and if people should be concerned?Public health investigators discovered that a certain sequence with multiple changes, including the spike protein, was on the rise in the U.K.Knowing the genome sequence helps researchers understand two important things – how the virus is mutating into variants and how it’s traveling from person to person.Take the B.1.1.7 variant, first detected in the United Kingdom, which has strong genomic surveillance in place.Fortunately, preliminary research that has not yet been peer-reviewed found that the B.1.1.7 variant remains susceptible to current vaccines.Now the U.S. faces a similar issue with a different type of test: genetic sequencing.As genomic epidemiologists and infectious disease experts, we perform these kinds of tests every day in our labs, working to puzzle out how the coronavirus is evolving and moving through the population.",

  "content": "Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said that at events he attended back home few people wear masks anymore and “the attitude is it’s time to get back to normal, get back to freedom.”  Leadership sets a tone, and California Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., the top Republican in the House, tried to suggest at a recent news conference that the GOP challenges to Biden’s victory were not intended to change the election outcome — despite Trump urging his supporters “fight like hell” on Jan. 6 as lawmakers were certifying the 2020 election results.“The mood is toxic,” said Rep. Rodney Davis, R-Ill. “I mean, it really sucks to be in the minority, but it’s really worse when there’s just such a high partisan temperature.”  It came to a pressure point this past week when a dozen Republicans voted against awarding the Congressional Gold Medal to law enforcers who defended the Capitol, in part because the resolution mentioned the “insurrectionists” who attacked the “temple” of American democracy.Republicans say it’s Democrats who just need to get over it — move on from the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol , end the COVID-19 restrictions and make an effort toward bipartisanship.One Trump-aligned Republican lawmaker, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, has started gumming up Democrats’ floor operations by demanding roll calls on routine legislation, testing lawmakers’ patience as already lengthy House proceedings drag into late-night sessions.ADVERTISEMENT  Not yet 100 days into the new Congress, the legislative branch has become an increasingly toxic and unsettled place, with lawmakers frustrated by the work-from-home limits imposed by the coronavirus and suspicious of each other after the Jan. 6 riot over Donald Trump’s presidency.Give me a break.”  It’s clear that Democrats are more emotionally spent than House Republicans, who bolstered their ranks in the last election despite Trump’s loss.ADVERTISEMENT  Despite the charged atmosphere, the House is forging ahead with Biden’s agenda, the Democratic majority ushering the $1.9 trillion virus relief bill into law without support from a single Republican.“There are moments when I’m very excited and very happy, some really great things are happening,” said Massachusetts Rep. Jim McGovern, the House Rules Committee chairman who skipped the elevator when he saw it was carrying Republicans who challenged the presidential vote.“You know, I do sometimes just close my eyes and like picture this place in the way that it used to be, and how welcoming it was,” said Omar, first elected in 2018.“You know, I do sometimes just close my eyes and like picture this place in the way that it used to be, and how welcoming it was,” said Omar, first elected in 2018.An immigrant from Somalia, she said she draws on the coping skills she learned as a child in wartime to enter the razor-wire fenced Capitol, now with armed members of the National Guard, to “try to pretend that that’s not what it is.”  The first months of the year have laid bare the scars from the historic, unprecedented events.For now, House proxy voting that was put in place to lessen lawmakers’ health risks of traveling to Washington will persist.Particularly in the House, which remains partly shuttered by the pandemic and where lawmakers heard gunshots ring out during the siege, trust is low, settled facts about the riot are apparently up for debate and wary, exhausted members are unsure how or when the “People’s House” will return to normal.She said she is hoping for some assurances from her Republican colleagues that they’re all committed to the same goal of “upholding our democracy.”  “If we want to get back to normal,” she said, “we have to be better than we are.”One problem in resuming fully in-person operations at the Capitol is the lack of vaccinations for thousands of staff to the 435 House members.",

  "content": "Trump ended up making three Supreme Court appointments to go along with 54 appellate court picks and 174 trial judges, aided by then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s determination to, as he put it, “leave no vacancy behind.”  Democrats and their progressive allies say they’ve learned a lesson or two from the Republicans, and intend to make judicial nominations a greater focus than in past Democratic administrations.They are among the roughly 10% of federal judgeships that are or will soon be open, giving Biden his first chance to make his mark on the American judiciary.Scott Applewhite, File)  WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden has two seats to fill on the influential appeals court in the nation’s capital that regularly feeds judges to the Supreme Court.President Joe Biden has two seats to fill on the influential appeals court in the nation's capital that regularly feeds judges to the Supreme Court.President Joe Biden has two seats to fill on the influential appeals court in the nation's capital that regularly feeds judges to the Supreme Court.That’s because Republicans who controlled the Senate in the final two years of the Obama White House confirmed relatively few judges.Biden’s appointments are also the only concrete moves he has right now to affect the judiciary at large, though there is talk about expanding the number of judges on lower courts.One seat is held by Merrick Garland, whose confirmation as attorney general is expected in the coming days.White House counsel Dana Remus wrote senators in December that recommendations for new judges should come within 45 days of a vacancy.President Barack Obama nominated Garland to the Supreme Court, but Senate Republicans didn’t give him even a hearing, much less a vote.Barring an improbable expansion of the Supreme Court , Biden won’t be able to do anything about the high court’s entrenched conservative majority any time soon.Biden already has pledged to name a Black woman to the Supreme Court if a seat opens up.Included in the tally are 10 seats on federal courts of appeals where nearly all appeals, other than the few dozen decided by the Supreme Court each year, come to an end.ADVERTISEMENT  Democrats traditionally have not made the judiciary a focus, but that is changing after four years of Trump and the vast changes he made .“Our view is we would like to see them prioritize experiential diversity, which would be new and different from the two previous Democratic administrations,” said Nan Aron, president of the liberal Alliance for Justice, referring to the Obama and Clinton presidencies.",

  "content": "Comets like 2I/Borisov, which have not passed close to the sun, are of special interest, because the material they are made up of is the same as when the solar system had been formed.However, there would be a magnetic field originating from another star in interstellar space.This suggested that the comet could be more pristine than others and that it has not been affected by particles from gas clouds and energy since it has not passed near a star.“Scientists define the beginning of interstellar space as the place where the sun’s constant flow of material and magnetic field stop affecting its surroundings.It marks the end of a region created by our sun that is called the heliosphere,” NASA wrote, defining interstellar space.Again, according to NASA, comets can be defined as “frozen leftovers from the formation of the solar system composed of dust, rock and ices.Scientists have discovered two new ways that 2I/Borisov is different from any other known comets.They range from a few miles to tens of miles wide.”  When a comet comes near the sun, it gets heated up and can throw gases and dust which appear as a glowing head, the size of which can be larger than a planet.2I/Borisov was first detected in 2019 when it came close to the solar system.Here, the number of cold particles increases and the magnetic field from the sun no longer exists.Researchers found that 2I/Borisov came from an interstellar space and its behaviour nearly confirms that it is a comet.",

  "content": "She particularly notes the authors’ calculation that 45 percent of plant species went extinct following the meteorite collision, because “current estimates suggest that at least this many plant species will be globally threatened in the Amazon basin in the next 30 years from human activities alone.”  “The question remains: How will human impact change the composition and function of Amazonian forests forever?” Dunn says.“The authors demonstrate that the dinosaur extinction was also a massive reset event for neotropical ecosystems, putting their evolution on an entirely new path leading directly to the extraordinary, diverse, spectacular and gravely threatened rain forests in the region today.”  These insights, Wilf adds, “provide new impetus for the conservation of the living evolutionary heritage in the tropics that supports human life, along with millions of living species.”  Carlos Jaramillo, a paleobiologist at the Panama-based Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute and co-lead author of the study, agrees that the meteorite’s evolutionary and ecological effects hold implications for today’s rapid, human-caused destruction of the Amazon rain forest and other key habitats across the planet.“We can relate this to nowadays,” he says, “because we’re also transforming landscapes, and that lasts forever—or at least a very long time.”  Analysis of some 50,000 pollen grains and 6,000 fossil leaves reveals that the meteorite that wiped out nonavian dinosaurs also gave rise of the Amazon rain forest.A new study shows how those casualties, in turn, led to another particularly profound evolutionary outcome: the emergence of the Amazon rain forest of South America, the most spectacularly diverse environment on the planet.Along with many of the animals they supported, a total of 45 percent of the continent’s tropical plant species disappeared, according to the authors’ calculations.Also Read | Comet from edge of solar system killed the dinosaurs: Study  Their findings paint a picture of a sudden, cataclysmic annihilation of life after the impact—but also of a phoenix-like rebirth in the millions of years afterward.Many academic and amateur fossil hunters have also tended to write off warm, wet locales as a lost cause for finds because they have assumed that conditions there would prevent organic materials from being preserved long enough to fossilize.The researchers studied those features among the collected fossils to piece together the structure of the region’s past forests.Today we are in the midst of another such event, she adds, but this one is driven by a single species—and there is no place far from the metaphorical impact crater “because humans are ubiquitous.”  Yet unlike past mass extinction events, Jacobs says, this time “we are not powerless to stop it.”It took six million years for the forests to return to the level of diversity they had before the meteorite, and the species that slowly grew back were completely different than what came before.Read | World's first preserved dinosaur atop nest with fossilised embryos found in China  Modern-day rain forests are integral to life on Earth.“It took us a long time,” he says, “because we had to start from zero.”  Whole trees are almost never preserved in the fossil record, so Jaramillo and his colleagues turned to fossilized pollen and leaves for insights.",

  "content": "(Courtney Africa/Pool via AP, File)  CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — In countries with historic ties to Britain, allegations by Prince Harry and Meghan that an unnamed member of the royal family had “concerns” over how dark their unborn baby’s skin might be have raised a thorny question: Do those nations really want to be so closely connected to Britain and its royal family anymore?In countries with historic ties to Great Britain, allegations by Prince Harry and Meghan about racism within the royal family have raised questions about whether those nations want to be closely connected to Britain anymore after the couple's interview with Oprah Winfrey.In countries with historic ties to Great Britain, allegations by Prince Harry and Meghan about racism within the royal family have raised questions about whether those nations want to be closely connected to Britain anymore after the couple's interview with Oprah Winfrey.I don’t know why we are still a part of it.”  Meghan and Harry’s complaints of racism show that it is time for her country to end its relationship with the royal family, said a retired professor in Kingston, Jamaica.In Kenya, a former colony where a young Princess Elizabeth was visiting in 1952 when she learned about the death of her father and thus that she would become queen, news of the interview also has begun appearing in the country’s newspapers.“After the end of the queen’s reign, that is the time for us to say: OK, we’ve passed that watershed,” Turnbull told Australian Broadcasting Corp. “Do we really want to have whoever happens to be the head of state, the king or queen of the U.K., automatically our head of state?”  The value of the Commonwealth has been debated before, with critics questioning if countries and people once colonized — and even oppressed — should remain in such an association with a former colonizer.He cited “unresolved issues” in his country relating to the abuses of colonialism and questioned whether the heads of Commonwealth countries should still be “proud to eat dinner” with members of the British royal family, considering the accusations.In a speech to mark Commonwealth Day on Monday, the queen spoke of “the spirit of unity.”  Charismatic royals like Harry and Meghan have been deployed in the past to Commonwealth-related events with young people, businesses and volunteer groups.Lawyer Sunaina Phul said the Commonwealth “is relevant to the royal family, of course, because it shows that they ruled so many places.If people want to later talk about constitutional change and shifting our system of government that’s fine, and they can have those conversations, but right now I’m not having those conversations.”  Jagmeet Singh, leader of the opposition New Democratic Party, said the monarchy “is in no way beneficial to Canadians in terms of their everyday life.”  “And with the systematic racism that we’ve seen, it seems to be in that institution as well,” he said.The interview was not shown on TV in India, the Commonwealth’s most populous member country with 1.3 billion people, but it still was covered by the media and drew negative reactions from the public toward the royals.They oppressed us for years.”  Meghan and Harry traveled to South Africa in 2019, where their impending split with the royal family became clearer and they even spoke of possibly living in Cape Town.",

  "content": "Scott Applewhite, File)  WASHINGTON (AP) — President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package is being hailed by Democrats and progressive policy advocates as a generational expansion of the social safety net, providing food and housing assistance, greater access to health care and direct aid to families in what amounts to a broad-based attack on the cycle of poverty.The package also includes what amounts to the biggest expansion of federal help for health insurance since the Obama-era Affordable Care Act more than 10 years ago.“Getting something out of the code is often times harder than getting something into the code,” House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, D-Mass., told reporters Tuesday, referring to the relief bill’s expansion of the child tax credit.He added, “What we did is unlikely to go away.”  At this point, the child tax credit expansion would expire at the end of the year without some sort of congressional intervention.“It’s a recognition that the social safety net is not working and was not working prior to the pandemic.”  Biden himself, when signing the package into law Thursday, referenced it as an overt attempt to redraw the country’s economic fault lines in a way that’s bigger than the pandemic.In promoting the child tax credit expansion, Democrats rallied around an analysis that predicted it would cut nationwide child poverty by 45%.Several million people could see their health insurance costs reduced, and there’s also an incentive for states to expand Medicaid coverage, if they haven’t already done so.And House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., called it “one of the most transformative and historic bills any of us will ever have the opportunity to support.”  Perry in particular pointed to the expansion of the child tax credit system as a potentially foundational change.Biden’s $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package is being hailed by Democrats and progressive policy advocates as a generational expansion of the social safety net, providing food and housing assistance, greater access to health care and direct aid to families in what amounts to a broad-based attack on the cycle of poverty.Biden’s $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package is being hailed by Democrats and progressive policy advocates as a generational expansion of the social safety net, providing food and housing assistance, greater access to health care and direct aid to families in what amounts to a broad-based attack on the cycle of poverty.The legislation provides families with up to $3,600 this year for each child and also expands the credit to millions of families currently making too little to qualify for the full benefits.But the provision is projected to lift millions of families out of poverty, and progressives believe there will be tremendous pressure on Republicans to allow the change.“The question will be do they want child poverty to go back up again” by letting that credit expire, said Steve Wamhoff, director of federal tax policy for the liberal Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.Housing advocates give generally positive reviews, saying the massive relief packages for both renters and home owners should be enough to stave off the debts incurred so far.",

  "content": "Overall, we believe the Rupee will track the broader dollar, but the Beta (sensitivity) of USD/INR would be relatively low in comparison to currencies of other EMs with idiosyncratic risks.We see a limited downside in US real rates from current levels and therefore we see limited room for USD weakness overall.If the inflation and employment data from the US consistently beat estimates, we could see the markets bring forward expectations of withdrawal of accommodation by the Fed.Portfolio flows would be determined by the outlook on Fed policy and US rates.The biggest downside risk in USD/INR could stem from possible inclusion in a global bond index.This could result in outflows from domestic stocks and bonds.We would be far more resilient to external shocks such as a spike in crude prices or a US rate hike cycle.According to recent reports, we could possibly see this happen in the second half of this fiscal.Going forward, with normalization of economic activity, the current account is expected to return to the deficit.A higher USD/INR closing on financial year-end would augment MTM on RBI's FX Reserves.One must give full credit to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for the way it has managed the Indian Rupee's movement in FY21.The 3-month implied volatility in USD/INR during the peak of the COVID crisis was barely 11 percent compared to 20 percent during the Taper Tantrum period in 2013 and close to 30 percent during the Sub-Prime mortgage crisis back in 2007.If tighter restrictions are enforced due to rising cases, it would certainly weigh on Indian assets and the Rupee.If Indian sovereign bonds get included in a bond index, it will attract a lot of passive flows that track the index.",

  "content": "NASA’s OSIRIS-REx spacecraft will get one last close encounter with Bennu on April 7 as it performs a final flyover to capture images of the asteroid’s surface.This final flyby of Bennu will provide the mission team an opportunity to learn how the spacecraft’s contact with Bennu’s surface altered the sample site and the region surrounding it.While performing the flyover, the spacecraft will observe Bennu from a distance of about 3.7 km – the closest it jhas been since the Touch-and-Go Sample Collection event on October 20, 2020, NASA said on Thursday.The spacecraft will remain in asteroid Bennu’s vicinity until May 10, when the mission will enter its Return Cruise phase and begin its two-year journey back to Earth.NASA’s OSIRIS-Rex will join the two other missions: Japan’s Hayabusa 2 that brought samples from asteroid Ryugu and China’s Chang’e 5 mission that will bring samples from the lunar surface.Scientists will also investigate how planets formed and how life began, as well as improve the understanding of asteroids that could impact Earth.The spacecraft will remain close to asteroid Bennu and enter its Earth Return Cruise phase on May 10, 2021.Because Bennu’s gravity is so weak, these various forces from the spacecraft had a dramatic effect on the sample site — launching many of the region’s rocks and a lot of dust in the process.Once recovered, the capsule will be transported to the curation facility at the agency’s Johnson Space Center in Houston, where the sample will be removed for distribution to laboratories worldwide, enabling scientists to study the formation of our solar system and Earth as a habitable planet, NASA said.",

  "image": "https://www.xda-developers.com/files/2021/03/Realme-8-Pro-review-Infinite-blue-128GB-2.jpg",
  "content": "Aside from the changes brought about by Android 11, the new features added to Realme UI include:  New accent colors including 10 single-color options and five dual-color options for the theme  Customizable icons for apps and quick settings options  Three different dark modes with varying intensity of the dark shade  New Always-On Display options (which are not available on the Realme 8 Pro yet).We will be comparing the images taken with the Realme 8 Pro and the Mi 10i to see which brand makes better use of the sensor’s capabilities.When we crop out a small section of the 12MP and 108MP images taken with the two devices and compare them side-by-side, we see the images taken with Xiaomi Mi 10i have brighter highlights, more exposure, and more clarity.I took off the screen protector right after unboxing the phone and have been using it for the duration of my review like this without noticing any scratches on the display.The smartphone is intended to woo users with a striking design but misses out on features that are becoming more mainstream for this price range — such as a higher refresh rate display.Overall, the Realme 8 Pro feels well-built for its price, although brands like Xiaomi are already using glass instead of plastic for a more premium feeling.A 108MP camera is a leading highlight of the Realme 8 Pro, and it is the company’s first step forward from the 64MP cameras seen on numerous devices, starting with the Realme XT.It may not sit well with consumers, especially when Redmi’s Note 10 Pro (Note 10 Pro Max in India) offers so much more for similar pricing.Besides the updated primary camera and a new design, the Realme 8 Pro is nearly identical to the Realme 7 Pro.Even when it comes to the quality, the Realme 8 Pro’s display lacks the same punchiness or color saturation that we see on more expensive AMOLEDs.The successive ISOCELL HM1 sensor from Samsung was made for flagships like the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra and did not make sense for a brand like Realme, which targets the mid-range of the market for most of its sales.Design and Build  In its early days, the striking designs of Realme smartphones helped the brand gain users’ attention.Not just that, Xiaomi and especially the Redmi Note series also enjoy much more support from the developer community, allowing users to migrate to a custom ROM if they do not like the stock firmware that comes with the smartphone.Notably, it is easy to draw similarities between the designs of the Realme 8 Pro and the OPPO F17 Pro, looking at the square design of the camera bump.The use of Snapdragon 720G shows that Realme does not intend to compete in the market on the basis of performance and is clearly focused on crowing the 108MP camera.Unlike many other smartphones in the price segment, the Realme 8 Pro has a slim profile and is easy to wield, thanks to the curved edges on the back.The images taken with the Mi 10i have more neutral colors and an even exposure throughout the canvas, but the 108MP is not as sharp as the 12MP image or the ones taken with the Realme 8 Pro.Don’t be deceived by the Realme 8 Pro’s fabulous looks and competitive camera  Over the last three years, Realme has paved its way into the top 10 smartphone brands globally with numerous product lineups and recurring launches.Night Mode  Using the Realme 8 Pro’s inbuilt Nightscape Mode, you can capture images with better contrast and improved sharpness than without it.Even in low-light, the images turn out to be fairly sharp and well-defined.Instead of using a long-exposure mode, Realme captures multiple images at different ISO levels and then superimposes them for a more contrasty image.Ultrawide angle  In addition to the standard 108MP camera, the Realme 8 Pro also features an 8MP ultrawide angle fixed-focus camera with a 123° wide field of view.The latter also comes with 108MP cameras, comparable performance, similar RAM, and MIUI, which has the same pitfalls as Realme UI — if not worse.If you want better camera performance, the Mi 10i (aka Mi 10T Lite or Redmi Note 9 Pro 5G China) benefits from the bigger aperture lens attached to the primary camera.Although the fast charging rate is capped at 50W on the Realme 8 Pro, you actually get a 65W charger in the box, and it can be used to charge any other Realme, OPPO, or OnePlus device with up to 65W fast charging support.The Realme 8 Pro has excellent battery backup and went from 100% to 30% battery after over a day of moderate usage, mostly web browsing and watching videos on YouTube at auto-brightness.Realme did succeed in this attempt with its initial devices, and its early phones, such as the Realme 3 Pro, showed us that Realme could be a promising smartphone brand.Other Camera Features  Aside from these camera features noted above, the Realme 8 Pro also supported other notable ones such as Pro mode, Pro video mode, EIS, and Starry Mode, which is Realme’s take on Google Astrophotography mode.It brings 108MP camera and 50W fast charging at a very affordable price point along with decent performance.Things I dislike about the Realme 8 Pro  Display refresh rate and slow fingerprint scanner  The Realme 8 Pro features the same 6.4-inch Full HD+ AMOLED display that we have seen on its predecessor — the Realme 7 Pro.However, one thing to note is that the colors appear artificially amplified even when the AI enhancement is turned off.Not only does it improve the lighting, but it also makes the images appear much sharper.Realme 8 Pro features faster charging, though.One-hand icon launch gesture, which compresses the grid of icons into a smaller, more accessible grid that facilitates easier app launch  Experimental features such as Sleep Capsule, which enables users to easily unwind at night by preventing usage after you set bedtime.Lastly, the in-display fingerprint scanner on the Realme 8 Pro fails to let you pass through at least one out of four times.Since then, the company has branched out into different product lineups and categories, and it seems it has been making some compromises while fearing to dare and leap forward with the same vigor as earlier.The sparkling design will surely grab other people’s attention, while the convenient footprint allows you to use the phone with ease.Realme 8 Pro does give Realme the bragging right for the “most affordable 108MP camera phone.” But despite that, it does not give you the impression of being a phone that is worth its pricing.If you want hardcore performance and can compromise on the camera, the POCO X3 Pro is another viable option.Therefore, the images captured using the primary camera have a 12MP size.However, the Redmi phone takes the lead with its 120Hz display, a bigger 5020mAh battery, and a better haptics engine.The images below were captured with the default settings without the AI scene enhancement feature.Besides, it is placed too close to the bottom edge of the display and may require you to stretch your thumb to access it.Primary 12MP  To start off, here are some images that were taken with the primary camera on the Realme 8 Pro.The back panel and the frame on the side are made of polycarbonate, which, in turn, helps maintain a low weight.The trend continues with the Realme 8 Pro, which features an anti-glare crystal finish on the back.",

  "content": "“… so when the decision goes to the third umpire, let the technology take over; just like in Tennis – it’s either in or out, there’s nothing in between,” Tendulkar had said.Under the new rule, more than half the ball needs to hit the top edge of the bails for the on-field decision to be reversed on review.For two reasons… ‘The umpire’s decision is final’ is one of the basic tenets of cricket.For soft-signal, the Committee proposed that the on-field umpires could give an “unsighted” signal to the TV umpire for catches outside the 30-yard circle.Umpire’s call is about the DRS giving the benefit of the doubt to the decision taken by the on-field umpire.Umpire’s Call allows that to happen, which is why it is important it remains,” Kumble said via the ICC press release.But the ICC has confirmed the retention of ‘umpire’s call’, so it is presumed that soft signal will not be done away with.Following the rule change, the area up to the top edge of the bails will come into play.A player can now ask the umpire if “a genuine attempt has been made to play the ball” (deliberate padding or not) before going for an LBW review.The game’s governing body didn’t categorically mention anything about soft signal; a matter of debate following a couple of contentious decisions during the recently concluded India versus England T20I series.Why does the rule allow the benefit of the doubt to on-field umpire?“According to me, umpire’s call right now is creating a lot of confusion.If the ball is clipping the stumps, that should be out whether you like it or not, you lose the review,” he added.Soft signal for catches is also an on-field umpire’s call.",

(AP) — The 13 people killed in one of the deadliest highway crashes involving migrants sneaking into the U.S. had entered California through a section of border fence with Mexico that was cut away, apparently by smugglers, immigration officials said Wednesday.Thirteen people killed in one of the deadliest border crashes on record were among more than 40 migrants who entered the U.S. through the hole cut into Southern California's border fence with Mexico, the Border Patrol said Wednesday.Thirteen people killed in one of the deadliest border crashes on record were among more than 40 migrants who entered the U.S. through the hole cut into Southern California's border fence with Mexico, the Border Patrol said Wednesday.This photo provided by the US Customs and Border Protection shows a hole cut into Southern California's border fence with Mexico on Wednesday, March 3, 2021.ADVERTISEMENT  The crash happened in an area that became a major route for illegal border crossings in the late 1990s after heightened enforcement in San Diego pushed migrants to more remote areas.The Suburban carried 19 people, and it caught fire for unknown reasons on a nearby interstate after entering the U.S. All escaped the vehicle and were taken into custody by Border Patrol agents.(US Customs and Border Protection via AP)  This photo provided by the US Customs and Border Protection shows a hole cut into Southern California's border fence with Mexico on Wednesday, March 3, 2021.If it had 25 people inside, that would easily exceed the payload limit, taxing the brakes and making it tougher to steer the vehicle, said Frank Borris, former head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s Office of Defects Investigation.Full Coverage: California  It’s not clear if the SUV ran the stop sign or had stopped before entering the highway.How fast both vehicles were going also wasn’t yet known.Seats in the SUV had been removed except for those for the driver and front passenger, said Omar Watson, chief of the California Highway Patrol’s border division.The Expedition is built to hold eight people safely, but smugglers are known to pack people into vehicles in extremely unsafe conditions to maximize their profits.",
